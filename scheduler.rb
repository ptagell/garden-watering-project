# I stumbled across an issue whereby the GrovePi would need resetting (RST light woudl activate). This line resets the GrovePi before trying toÂ run any commands with it. Important to do it before each watering session to increase the chances it doesn't fail during the watering session (and keep watering...watering...watering)
